# Cardiovascular Disease Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze cardiovascular disease data to identify significant factors and build a predictive model for heart attacks. The analysis includes data inspection, statistical summaries, and a baseline logistic regression model.


## Project Description

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally. This project involves analyzing a dataset containing various health factors to understand the distribution and impact of these factors on heart health. The goal is to explain the data in detail and develop a system to predict heart attacks effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information on various factors related to heart health. The data dictionary, provided separately in an Excel file, details each variable.

## Data Dictionary

The data dictionary provides descriptions for each variable in the dataset, including:

- Age
- Gender
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Levels
- Peak Exercise
- Thalassemia
- Presence of CVD (target variable)
- ...and more

## Analysis Steps

1. **Preliminary Analysis**
    - Data inspection: Structure, missing values, duplicates.
    - Data cleaning: Remove duplicates, treat missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
    - Statistical summary: Central tendencies and spread.
    - Categorical variables analysis: Count plots.
    - CVD occurrence vs. Age analysis.
    - Gender composition analysis.
    - Resting Blood Pressure anomalies and heart attack detection.
    - Cholesterol levels and target variable relationship.
    - Peak exercise and heart attack occurrence.
    - Thalassemia and CVD.
    - Analysis of other factors.
    - Pair plot for variable relationships.
3. **Baseline Model**
    - Build a logistic regression model to predict CVD.
    - Explore the results.

## Results

The project provides detailed insights into the relationship between various health factors and cardiovascular disease, along with a baseline logistic regression model for heart attack prediction.
